# Code of Conduct

## Our pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the OneBit-LLM project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, level of experience, education, nationality, or identity.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, and healthy community.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment:

- Being respectful and inclusive
- Giving and accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward others

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, or personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information without permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or open-source setting

## Enforcement

Maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. Instances of abusive or unacceptable behavior may be reported to the maintainers. We will treat all reports seriously and respond as we deem appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (e.g. repositories, issues, pull requests, discussions) and when representing the project in public.
